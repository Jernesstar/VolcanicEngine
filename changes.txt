Adding this file, to track changes as a go between writing the code and testing the code.

So far:

Demo Status:
Bloom x
Collision x
Cube y
ECS y
Lighting y
Raycast x
Shadows y
Template y
UILayer y

change:
	Removed Point, Line, and Mesh buffers in OpenGL::Renderer::RendererData in favor of a single Geometry buffer
	Renamed VolcaniCore::Renderer::RenderCubemap -> DrawSkybox
	Renamed LinkHandles -> SetUniforms, class Handles -> Uniforms
	Moved files Scene, SceneSerializer -> Scene/
	Moved defines FrameDebugInfo::Max_ -> Renderer::Max_

feat_begin:
	Created Vertex.h
	Created structs DrawType, DrawPartition, DrawPrimitive, DrawCall
	Implementing DrawLine, DrawPoint, DrawMesh in OpenGL::Renderer,
	Removed DrawInstanced and DrawIndexed in OpenGL::Renderer;
	Implementing VolcaniCore::Renderer::CreateDrawCalls
	Defines.h now includes the usings 'List = std::vector', 'Map = std::unordered_map', and 'Func = std::function'
	Work in Buffer.h, implementing Add(Buffer), Add(List)

feat_end:
	Application calculates the FPS
	struct TextureSlot
	Uniforms::Set now deduces template argument from lambda return type
	Uncapped FPS by calling glfwSetSwapInterval(0)
	RendererAPI can now set options: DepthTesting and BlendingMode
	In VolcaniCore::Renderer, Transforms now go into TransformBuffer

todo:
	Change all instances of vector, unordered_map and function to their corresponding using definitions
	Work on Editor, start small
	Work on Scene
	Work on Game
